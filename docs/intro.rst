What is EDA Playground?
***********************

EDA Playground gives engineers immediate hands-on exposure to simulating and synthesizing SystemVerilog, Verilog, VHDL, C++/SystemC, and other HDLs. All you need is a web browser. 

* With a simple click, run your code and see console output in real time. 
* View waves for your simulation using `EPWave <http://epwave.readthedocs.org>`_ browser-based wave viewer.
* Save your code snippets ("Playgrounds"). 
* Share your code and simulation results with a web link. Perfect for web forum discussions or emails.
  Great for asking questions or sharing your knowledge.
* Quickly try something out

  * Try out a language feature with a small example.
  * Try out a library that you're thinking of using.
