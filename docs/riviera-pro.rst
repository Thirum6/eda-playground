*2014/08/13*

We are excited to announce the availability of Aldec's Riviera-PRO EDU simulator on
`EDA Playground <http://courses.edaplayground.com>`_. Riviera-PRO is a full-featured
commercial simulator that has full support for SystemVerilog, VHDL, and SystemC.

The goal of EDA Playground has always been to accelerate learning and give engineers immedate hands-on exposure to simulating HDLs.
Finally, **for the first time ever**, students and engineers can easily try out all of SystemVerilog's features.

Riviera-PRO brings some key SystemVerilog features that previously were not available on EDA Playground:

* Randomization
* SystemVerilog assertions
* Functional coverage
* ``program`` blocks

The following video demonstrates SystemVerilog's randomization and functional coverage features.
