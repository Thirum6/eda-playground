=============================

Version 17

**Keyboard short cuts** can be found `here <http://eda-playground.readthedocs.org/en/latest/edaplayground_shortcuts.html>`_. **Full instructions** on using EDA Playground can be found `here <http://eda-playground.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_.

Note: When an exercise or solution has several parts, there is a
hyphenated playground for the respective part. Oddly, some labs may not
have a part 1 because it is not referred to that way in the workbook.
