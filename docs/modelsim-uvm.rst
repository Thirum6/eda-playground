#######################
Using UVM with ModelSim
#######################

ModelSim 10.1d supports all SystemVerilog/Verilog features except:

* SystemVerilog assertions
* SystemVerilog coverage
* ``randomize`` method
* ``program`` blocks

  * Dave Rich from Mentor does not recomment the use of ``program`` blocks for any user: http://go.mentor.com/programblocks

Out of the above, only the ``randomize`` method is used by the UVM library.

UVM can be used with ModelSim 10.1d as long as the following coding style adjustments are followed:

* When creating a ``uvm_sequence``, put the following in the constructor: ``do_not_randomize = 1'b1;``

  .. code-block:: verilog

     class my_sequence extends uvm_sequence #(my_transaction);

     function new();
       // MUST BE SET when using ModelSim
       do_not_randomize = 1'b1;
     endfunction

* Then, before sending the request in your sequence, if you need randomization, use ``$urandom`` or other
  classic ways to achieve randomization for your request
* Do NOT use ```uvm_do*with`` macros
